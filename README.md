# Game Manager Extension

A SillyTavern extension that tracks story events, optimises the system prompt, and provides quick UI blocks for updating character cards, lorebook entries, and first-message suggestions – all inside the Extensions drawer.

## Setup
1. Copy this folder to `extensions/game-manager` inside your SillyTavern install.
2. Enable **Game Manager** in SillyTavern’s Extensions tab.
3. (Optional) Edit `optimizer.js` to add real dedupe/prune logic.
